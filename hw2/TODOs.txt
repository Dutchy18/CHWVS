Known bugs:
- When pushing the below example from the right, an infinite recursion occurs.
Example: 777
         667
         777

Unmet requirements:
- A ship can only push up to it's mass.
- The ships can combine their force on a single item when pushing.

Student dependent decisions:
- An item that falls indirectly on a ship is not considered as crashed into the ship.
- The small ship may rotate in the same cycle as moving/advancing/position-changing.
